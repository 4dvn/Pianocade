- No ground connections
- No mounting holes
- More space between jacks, especially MIDI, power switch
- PORT E and PORT F labels reversed
- SMD resistors and cap labels illegible
- Switch to through hole 358 (for power reasons)
- No silkscreen marker on ICSP header
- REVERSE CURRENT PROTECTION ON REGULATOR (Add diode)
- Wider traces everywhere
- Resistors on board for hold button LEDs
- Add labels to DAC pins

- ?Add external reset button? 
- ?Flip middle 8 notes so they're in linear order?
- ?Get rid of power switch?
- ?Add automatic power selection between power jack and USB bus?
- ?Add diodes to each of the 5V sources, so they can both be connected simultaneously?
- ?Add resettable fuse to USB power line?

	Potential power setup: DC line/battery (POWERIN) through reverse-current diode (VIN) 
through regulator (+5V). VIN goes to the gate of a MOSFET, so that if it's higher than VUSB, 
current is BLOCKED from VUSB to +5V. If it's LOWER than VUSB (tied to GND through a pull-down),
then current CAN flow from VUSB. Need a P-Channel FET, I believe.
